### Endnotes
1. Does the external funder have a research data policy, or is a data access agreement or plan in place/required? If a data management plan is required, create one using [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/). [↑](#endnote-ref-1)
2. You should consider issues around Effectiveness, Fairness and Transparency here. See the ReDAI (Research Data for AI) service page and the Unified AI documentation – links to follow. [↑](#endnote-ref-2)
3. Useful resources: [UCL’s Harbour service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/harbour-ucls-external-data-service) for accessing third-party data; [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) – the registry of research data repositories. [↑](#endnote-ref-3)
4. Link to Library's copyright advice page? [↑](#endnote-ref-4)
5. If HPC = Yes, see <https://github.com/ucl-arc/condenser-users> [↑](#endnote-ref-5)
6. Does the data management environment require specific accreditation, e.g. NHS DSP Toolkit, ISO27001, etc? If so, see [UCL’s Information Governance pages](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/user/login?destination=node/4175). [↑](#endnote-ref-6)
7. If ethically sensitive, consult the [UCL Research Ethics Service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-innovation-services/compliance-and-assurance/research-ethics-service). If personal data will be processed, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is likely to be required. [↑](#endnote-ref-7)
